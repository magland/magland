## Jeremy Magland

Hello! I am a Data Scientist in the [Center for Computational Mathematics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-mathematics) at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron).

Some of the projects I am currently working on:

* [Figurl](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/figurl/blob/main/doc/intro.md)
* [Kachery](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/kachery-cloud/blob/main/README.md)
* [SortingView](https://github.com/magland/sortingview/blob/main/README.md)
* [SpikeInterface](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikeinterface/blob/master/README.md)

## Prior projects

Prior to being part of the Flatiron Institute, I was an Associate Research Professor in the Radiology Department at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Medicine. During my time there, I created [SequenceTree](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mrm.25640), a user-friendly GUI that builds and tests cutting-edge MRI research pulse sequences, with the capability of exporting them to be used on clinical scanners.

## Collaborators

Jeff Soules, also at the Center for Computational Mathematics, is a close collaborator on many of these projects. Other collaborators include the SpikeInterface team (especially Alessio Buccino), the [Loren Frank lab](https://franklab.ucsf.edu/), and Alex Williams' [NeuroStatsLab](http://neurostatslab.org/).


## Work in progress

I apologize for the disarray of some of my unfinished GitHub repositories and projects. I take advantage of GitHub for trial and error purposes. When I become more invested in a project, I move it to the [flatironinstitute](https://github.com/flatironinstitute) GitHub organization. However, some projects become outdated as time progresses. Others are still in the early stages and are located at [scratchrealm](https://github.com/scratchrealm). I'll make an effort to keep this page up to date; however, if you find it outdated, please let me know.

## AI-assisted docs

I have begun to employ AI to help me with composing documentation. It is only used to sharpen the precision of my writing, not to fabricate new (potentially untrustworthy) material.
