## Jeremy Magland

Hello! I am a Data Scientist in the [Center for Computational Mathematics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-mathematics) at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron).

Some of the projects I am currently working on:

* [Neurosift](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/neurosift)
* [Dendro](https://github.com/magland/dendro)
* [LINDI](https://github.com/neurodatawithoutborders/lindi)
* [Figurl](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/figurl/blob/main/doc/intro.md)
* [Kachery](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/kachery-cloud/blob/main/README.md)
* [MountainSort 5](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/mountainsort5)
* [SortingView](https://github.com/magland/sortingview/blob/main/README.md)
* [SpikeInterface](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikeinterface/blob/master/README.md)

Recent Presentations

* [Exploring and Analyzing NWB Datasets on DANDI with Neurosift and Dendro](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/neurosift/blob/main/doc/neurosift_dendro_MIT_workshop_sep_2024.md)

## Prior projects

Prior to being part of Flatiron Institute, I was an Associate Research Professor in the Radiology Department at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Medicine. During my time there, I created [SequenceTree](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mrm.25640), a user-friendly GUI that builds and tests cutting-edge MRI research pulse sequences, with the capability of exporting them to be used on clinical scanners.

## Collaborators

[Jeff Soules](https://github.com/jsoules), also at the Center for Computational Mathematics, is a close collaborator on many of these projects. Other collaborators include the SpikeInterface team (especially [Alessio Buccino](https://github.com/alejoe91) and [Samuel Garcia](https://github.com/samuelgarcia)), the [Loren Frank lab](https://franklab.ucsf.edu/), CatalystNeuro ([Ben Dichter](https://github.com/bendichter), [Luiz Tauffer](https://github.com/luiztauffer), [Cody Backer](https://github.com/CodyCBakerPhD)), [Alex Barnett](ahbarnett), and others.
