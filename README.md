## Jeremy Magland

Hello! I am a Data Scientist in the [Center for Computational Mathematics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-mathematics) at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron).

I develop computational tools and open-source software for scientific research, with a focus on data visualization, cloud-based platforms, and making complex datasets more accessible to researchers. My work spans various domains and emphasizes creating portable, reproducible solutions for the scientific community.

Here are a few of my recent projects

### Neurosift

Neurosift is a browser-based tool designed for the visualization of neuroscience data with a focus on NWB (Neurodata Without Borders) files, and enables interactive exploration of the DANDI Archive, EMBER Archive, and OpenNeuro online repositories.

With the CatalystNeuro team

### Figpack

figpack is a Python package for creating interactive scientific visualizations that can be displayed directly in web browsers and easily shared. Unlike traditional plotting libraries, figpack produces self-contained HTML bundles that include both the rendering logic and the underlying data. This makes figures portable, reproducible, and suitable for long-term archiving (for example, uploading to Zenodo).

### Stan Playground

Stan Playground is a browser-based editor and runtime environment for [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) models. Users can edit, compile, and run models, as well as analyze the results using built-in plots and statistics or custom analysis code in Python or R, all with no local installation required.

### DANDI AI Notebooks

An AI-powered system that helps researchers explore and analyze neurophysiology datasets in the [DANDI Archive](https://dandiarchive.org/). It includes a chat assistant for data exploration and an automated notebook generator that creates instructional Python notebooks tailored to specific datasets. This tool makes complex neuroscience data more accessible to researchers by reducing technical barriers to data reuse.

With Ben Dichter, Ryan Ly, and Oliver Ruebel

### MountainSort

Spike sorting software. The latest version of MountainSort is [Mountainsort 5](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/mountainsort5).

### LINDI

LINDI is a cloud-friendly file format and Python library designed for managing scientific data, especially Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) datasets. It offers an alternative to HDF5 and Zarr, maintaining compatibility with both, while providing features tailored for linking to remote datasets stored in the cloud, such as those on the DANDI Archive. LINDI's unique structure and capabilities make it particularly well-suited for efficient data access and management in cloud environments.

## nbfiddle

nbfiddle is a web-based Jupyter notebook interface that leverages your browserâ€™s storage for saving and managing notebooks. It is designed for self-contained Python notebooks that focus on data analysis, particularly when working with remote data sources such as the DANDI archive.

## SpikeInterface

I was part of the original team that created [SpikeInterface](https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a Python package that provides a unified framework for spike sorting and electrophysiological data analysis. Although I am no longer actively involved in its development, I contributed to its initial design and implementation.
