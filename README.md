## Jeremy Magland

Hello and welcome! I am a Data Scientist in the [Center for Computational Mathematics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-mathematics) at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron).

I hope you will forgive the clutter of under-construction GitHub repos and projects. You might relate... you make something, people start using it, and then you can't delete it without consequences. I use GitHub as a scratchspace for new ideas. When I am more serious about a project, I move it to the [flatironinstitute](https://github.com/flatironinstitute) GitHub organization. But even then, projects become obsolete over time. Other projects in preliminary phases are in [scratchrealm](https://github.com/scratchrealm). I'll try to keep this page up to date, so if you find it becoming stale, please let me know!

Among the projects I am involved with, the most relevent right now are:

* [figurl]([https://github.com/flatironinstitute/figurl/blob/main/doc/intro.md)
* [kachery-cloud](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/kachery-cloud/blob/main/README.md)
* [spikeforest](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/spikeforest/blob/main/README.md)
* [SortingView](https://github.com/magland/sortingview/blob/main/README.md)
* [SpikeInterface](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikeinterface/blob/master/README.md)

Jeff Soules, also at the Center for Computational Mathematics, is my close collaborator on most of these projects. Other collaborators include the SpikeInterface team (especially Alessio Buccino), the [Loren Frank lab](https://franklab.ucsf.edu/), and Alex Williams' [NeuroStatsLab](http://neurostatslab.org/).

## Spike Sorting

I am a co-organizer, along with Liam Paninski, of an Algorithms/modularization Spike Sorting Working Group that meets monthly to collaboratively improve electrophysiological spike sorting methods and to integrate various software projects. Much of this effort centers around the [SpikeInterface](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikeinterface/blob/master/README.md) Python package.

I am the principal developer of [MountainSort](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627317307456), an automated clustering approach and software package for electrophysiological spike sorting. It addresses the reproducibility problem in this field by limiting the number of adjustable sorting parameters with the goal of achieving a fully-automated spike sorting pipeline.

[SortingView](https://github.com/magland/sortingview/blob/main/README.md) is a web-based tool for visualizing, curating, and sharing the results of electrophysiological spike sorting.

## Web-based, shareable, interactive visualizations in the cloud

## Prior projects

Before joining the Flatiron Institute, I was an Associate Research Professor in the Department of Radiology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medince. There I developed [SequenceTree](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mrm.25640), an intuitive graphical user interface for developing and testing pulse
sequences for MRI research, with the capability of exporting novel research sequences to run on clinical scanners. The software is no longer maintained but is still being used in some research labs.
