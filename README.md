## Jeremy Magland

Hello! I am a Data Scientist in the [Center for Computational Mathematics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-mathematics) at the [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron).

Here are some of the projects I am currently working on:

* [figurl](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/figurl/blob/main/doc/intro.md)
* [kachery-cloud](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/kachery-cloud/blob/main/README.md)
* [spikeforest](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/spikeforest/blob/main/README.md)
* [SortingView](https://github.com/magland/sortingview/blob/main/README.md)
* [SpikeInterface](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikeinterface/blob/master/README.md)

Jeff Soules, also at the Center for Computational Mathematics, is my close collaborator on most of these projects. Other collaborators include the SpikeInterface team (especially Alessio Buccino), the [Loren Frank lab](https://franklab.ucsf.edu/), and Alex Williams' [NeuroStatsLab](http://neurostatslab.org/).

## Spike Sorting

I am a co-organizer, along with Liam Paninski, of an Algorithms/modularization Spike Sorting Working Group that meets monthly to collaboratively improve electrophysiological spike sorting methods and to integrate various software projects. Much of this effort centers around the [SpikeInterface](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikeinterface/blob/master/README.md) Python package.

I am the principal developer of [MountainSort](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627317307456), an automated clustering approach and software package for electrophysiological spike sorting. It addresses the reproducibility problem in this field by limiting the number of adjustable sorting parameters with the goal of achieving a fully-automated spike sorting pipeline. If you are wondering where to go to find the latest incarnation of this algorithm, [go here](https://github.com/magland/mountainsort4).

I am the co-developer of [SortingView](https://github.com/magland/sortingview/blob/main/README.md), a web-based tool for visualizing, curating, and sharing the results of electrophysiological spike sorting.

## Web-based, shareable, interactive visualizations in the cloud

## Prior projects

Before joining the Flatiron Institute, I was an Associate Research Professor in the Department of Radiology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medince. There I developed [SequenceTree](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mrm.25640), an intuitive graphical user interface for developing and testing pulse
sequences for MRI research, with the capability of exporting novel research sequences to run on clinical scanners.

## Code clutter

I hope you will forgive the clutter of under-construction GitHub repos and projects. I use GitHub as a scratchspace for new ideas. When I am more serious about a project, I move it to the [flatironinstitute](https://github.com/flatironinstitute) GitHub organization. But even then, projects become obsolete over time. Other projects in preliminary phases are in [scratchrealm](https://github.com/scratchrealm). I'll try to keep this page up to date, so if you find it becoming stale, please let me know!
